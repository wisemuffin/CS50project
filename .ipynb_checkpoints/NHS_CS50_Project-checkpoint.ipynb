To run one of these notebooks, you will need to create a Microsoft Azure account (we will likely create one of these later anyway, so now is a fine time). once you have created an account and signed in, you should be able to clone any one of these items using the \"Clone\" button (right above the \"Search\" bar). this will create a copy in your own personal Microsoft Azure library and will build a server and environment for you any time you launch it."
